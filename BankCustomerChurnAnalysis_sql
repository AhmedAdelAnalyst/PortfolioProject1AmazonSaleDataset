BANK CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS

The dataset that will be used today was provided by Kaggle. It has information about 10k bank customers .
Its features allow viewing Customers  from multiple dimensions, from CreditScore, Tenure, Balance ,Complain,
Satisfaction Score ,Card Type, Point Earned to customer location and product attributes. I'll use SQL Big Querry 
for the analysis and Tableau public for the visualisation.
